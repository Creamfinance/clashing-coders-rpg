In this level there are 2 new tiles: keys and locked doors. Keys work like normal ground tiles except a key will be added to your inventory when you step on such a tile.
From a single key tile you can only receive a key once; however, you can have multiple keys in your inventory. Locked doors are normally not traversable, but will be
unlocked automatically if you try to step on them with at least 1 key in your inventory. The key will be consumed in the process and the locked door will stay traversable,
so you can walk through it multiple times once you unlocked it.

The tiles are encoded as:
"K" - Key tile, weight: 1
"L" - Locked door, weight: 1, not traversable until opened

They are also given in the tileset though.

You can check the player's inventory by issuing a /player/status GET request. It will return you with the player's inventory under the "inventory" key. The inventory
will be returned as an object, with the item being the key and the number of it currently in the inventory as the value.

As an example, you can use this curl request:
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "x-token: [YOUR TOKEN]" -X GET "HTTP://contest.clashing-coders.at/player/status"

Which would return you a JSON-response like this:
{"position":{"x":12,"y":31},"inventory":{"keys":3},"steps":0}

Move your player from his starting position at (1,99) to the goal area between (x,x) and (y,y) to finish the level.
Be careful to let your algorithm chose the correct doors to open, as there are more doors than keys in this level.
