A tile also has a "weight" to it, which defines how many steps your character needs to walk on that tile. A level may introduce a limit to how long you character should take at most.

The weight of each tile used in a level's map is provided in the /level/X/start POST request under the "tileset" key; every tile in there will have a weight defined under the "weight" key.

This level for example consists of the following tiles:
#: Walls, not traversable
.: Ground, traversable, weight: 1
M: Mountain, traversable, weight: 5

Additionally, the /player/status GET request will provide you with the steps the player has already taken under the "steps" key.

Move your player from the his starting position (3,16) to the goal at 595 on the x-axis and anywhere on the y-axis in under 650 steps and POST to level/3/end to finish the level.
