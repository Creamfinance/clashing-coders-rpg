A tile also has a "weight" to it, which defines how many steps your character needs to walk on that tile. A level may introduce a limit to how long you character should take at most.

The weight of each tile used in a level's map is provided in the /level/X/start POST request under the "tileset" key; every tile in there will have a weight defined under the "weight" key.

This level for example consists of the following tiles:
#: Walls, not traversable
.: Ground, traversable, weight: 1
M: Mountain, traversable, weight: 5

Move your player from the starting position (3,3) to the goal at (138, 139), taking at most 600 steps.
