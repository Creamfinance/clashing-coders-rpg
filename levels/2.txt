Some tiles cannot be walked over. These tiles are defined as traversable: false in the tileset.
Trying to move on one of those tiles will leave the player standing on his position instead. It won't return you with an error though and the level will continue normally.

If you need to check for the players position on the server you can invoke the /player/status GET request, which will return you the player's position, amongst other things.

As an example, you can use this cURL command (if you have curl installed):
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "x-token: [YOUR TOKEN]" -X GET "HTTP://contest.clashing-coders.at/player/status"

It will provide you with a response like:
{"position":{"x":1,"y":1},"inventory":{},"steps":0}

This map will feature some wall to obstruct your way. Move the player from his starting position (5,5) to the ending area between (51,60) and (58,68) and POST to /level/2/end to finish the level.
