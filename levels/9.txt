In this level you have to push all buttons in the buildings which have a size of exactly 19 fields.

A building is enclosed by wall elements and must have a door.

The fields contained by the wall, excluding the wall and door itself, should amount to 19 fields including the button.

This level has two new tiles:
B: Button, traversable: true, weight: 1
D: Door, traversable: true, weight: 1

A button is automatically pressed when you walk on that tile.

After you pressed all the buttons necessary, POST to /level/9/end to finish the level.
